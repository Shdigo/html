            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a proud millennial, born in the vibrant 90s. <br><br>
				Life took me on an incredible journey â€“ I tied the knot in 2021 and became a parent in 2022, discovering the profound joys of family. <br><br>
				My professional journey began in graphic design, where I honed my creative skills. However, my true passion emerged when I delved into managing social media for a company. The experience revealed my keen interest in data, problem-solving, and the intricate workings behind the scenes. <br><br>
				Today, my career path has evolved, and I find myself drawn towards Quality Assurance and data analysis. I thrive on unraveling complexities and ensuring the seamless functionality of systems. </br>
				<br><br><b>Let's connect and explore the exciting intersections of technology and data together!</b>
